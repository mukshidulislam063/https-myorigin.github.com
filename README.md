Physics Data Analysis Website â€“ A web-based research tool built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Allows users to input experimental data (Voltage vs Current, multiple datasets), visualize graphs, plot curves, annotate graphs, download results, and perform scientific data analysis. Similar to Origin software, but runs directly in the browser.
